    "### History of RNN\n",

    "Inputs from past timestamps were introduced to the network changing the actual external inputs. Disadvantage: they had limited to the window of time chosen.\n",

    "### RNN's biggest flaws\n",
    "RNNs have a key flaw, as capturing relationships that span more than 8 or 10 steps back is practically impossible.\n",
    "This flaw stems from the \"vanishing gradient\" problem in which the contribution of information decays geometrically over time.\n",
    "As you may recall, while training our network we use backpropagation. In the backpropagation process we adjust our weight matrices with the use of a gradient. In the process, gradients are calculated by continuous multiplications of derivatives. The value of these derivatives may be so small, that these continuous multiplications may cause the gradient to practically \"vanish\".\n",

    "#### How to overcome that?\n",
    "* LSTM\n",
    "* Faster Hardware\n",
    "* Residual Networks: skipping (residual) connections as part of the network architecture (ResNets). They yield lower training error by reintroducing outputs from shallower layers in the network to compensate the vanishing data. (However, this doesn't solve the fundamental problem, it only avoids it.)\n",
    "* Other Activation Functions: ReLU suffers less from vanishing gradients (they saturate in one direction)"
